## Edgar and SaaS

Edgar is designed primarily to support ISVs that are building SaaS apps on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.

When building a SaaS app, it's critical to respond to subscription lifecycle events (purchased, suspended, reinstated, canceled, etc.) in as real time as possible so that, typically, ISVs are only paying for Azure resources (and other services) that their customers are paying for. Since most Azure services can be consumed using a "pay as you go" or PAYG pricing model, automating configuration of the underlying infrastructure needed to support SaaS subscriptions helps reduce financial risk and ensure profitability.
