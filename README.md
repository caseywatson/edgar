## Edgar and SaaS

Edgar is designed primarily to support ISVs that are building SaaS apps on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.

When building a SaaS app, it's critical to respond to subscription lifecycle events (purchased, suspended, reinstated, canceled, etc.) in as real time as possible so that, typically, ISVs are only paying for Azure resources (and other services) that their customers are paying for. Since most Azure resources as provided as a "pay as you go" or PAYG service, automating configuration of the underlying infrastructure needed to support a SaaS subscription helps reduce financial risk and enables ISVs to build profitable and highly-optimized SaaS pricing models.
