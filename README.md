## Edgar and SaaS

Edgar is designed primarily to support ISVs that are building SaaS apps on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.

The key to building profitable SaaS apps is to respond to subscription lifecycle events (purchases, suspensions, reinstatements, renewals, cancelations, etc.) as rapidly as possible as. Ideally, a SaaS ISV's cloud spend is tightly aligned with what their customers are paying for using the popular "pay as your go" or PAYG cloud spend model.
