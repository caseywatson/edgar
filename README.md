## Edgar and SaaS apps

Edgar is designed primarily to support ISVs that are building SaaS apps in the cloud.

Customers purchase subscriptions (e.g., annual, monthly, etc.) to SaaS apps published by an independent software vendors (or ISVs). Financially, it's critical that ISVs respond in as near real time as possible to subscription lifecycle events (e.g., purchases, suspensions, reinstatements, cancelations, etc.) to reconfigure the SaaS app's supporting cloud infrastructure. The idea is to continuously keep ISV revenue (what the ISV's customers are paying) and cloud spend in close alignment. When possible (depending on app tenancy model), ISVs should only be paying for cloud resources that their customers are paying for through their subscriptions.

Edgar leverages GitHub Actions to tighten the lead time between subscription-related events and cloud infrastructure configuration enabling customers to access their SaaS subscriptions faster and ISVs to reduce idle resources and optimize cloud spend.
